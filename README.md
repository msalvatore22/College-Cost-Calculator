# College Cost Calculator
## The College Cost Calculator will help high school students discover the real cost of attending college. Users will be able to search the colleges they are interested in, submit a form based on that college and variables associated with the costs of college, and based on their inputs a calculation will be made to estimate how much they will owe once they graduate from that school. The target user will be high school seniors. I will be using the US Department of Education College Scorecard API to gather information about colleges to display and to make calculations. The key feature would be the users ability to add their top ten colleges into the app and then run multiple cost calculations on those schools.
